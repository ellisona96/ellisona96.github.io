1.  Describe the web-application you intend to build (in detail please!)

I am working on building a game for my web application.  The basis of the game is a playing field that displays objects randomly on this field.  Each object is randomized from a selection of three different colored gems.  These gems are worth a certain amount of points.  The objective of the game is to click on the gems to earn points.  The player has 10 seconds to earn the highest possible score.  Along with the game, there is a high score page that continually updates based on the players’ scores.  I will also be adding a login page so users can log in and keep their scores saved between visits.


2.  Indicate how you expect the application will make use of the required technical complexity items (e.g. file I/O, sessions, multi-dimensional arrays, etc.)

I intend to make use of the intended technical complexity items to keep track of scores based on each user.  The scores will be saved in a data file.  Sessions will track scores and store them in a file.  In terms of multi-dimensional arrays, I plan on keeping user information from the login page stored with this method.


3.  What is your plan to ensure you successfully complete your project before the end of the semester?

My plan is to have the game complete by this weekend.  Then this coming week, leading up to the screencast, I will be working on integrating cookies into my game, the login page, and registration page.


4.  What progress have you made so far and what is left for you to do?

I have completed the game and score page already, I just have to work on the technical aspects of my application.  I need to make a login page, a file to store user data, and add cookies to my game.
